Hey! 

This is Expandable TableView and JSON Parsing 

This demo is written by **MVVM**  and the binding view is done by Delegate (Maybe later we add RxSwift), **SOLID** and 

1- Make it work 

2- Make it better 

3- Make it fast

5- Document it 


This demo start by calling the menu api request then get all the menues which contains items as arraylist 
then each menu can be expandable to show the list of item and each item has name and description and description is optional so the  height of the cell 
is dynamic based on the content
